# This is a sample keymap file for tetrominotris
#
# Note that the left/right arrow keys are ALWAYS available for left/right
# movement; likewise, the down arrow is ALWAYS available for soft-drop.
# Those three events are NOT mandatory in a keymap file, but all others
# are.
#
#    RESET, PAUSE, HARD DROP, ROTATE ANTICLOCKWISE, ROTATE CLOCKWISE
#
# The lines are key-value pairs, separated by an equal sign.  The key
# is a whitespace-delimited list of printable characters OR the single
# special key, SPACE.  The value is the event name to associate with
# that list of keys.
