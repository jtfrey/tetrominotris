	@header Scoreboard
	The scoreboard tracks statistics and scoring information for
	a game:
	
	    - the count of each tetromino type placed on the board
	    - the number of times each line-clearing type has occurred
	    - the base point value for each line-clearing type
	    - the total number of lines cleared
	    - the number of lines that must be cleared to advance the
	      level
	    - the line count at which the level next increases
	    - the current level
	    - total points scored
	    
	All functions are very simple and are declared for static
	inlining to avoid function calls as much as possible.
